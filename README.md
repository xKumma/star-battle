# A Java implementation of the puzzle game STAR BATTLE made as a university project with me as the team lead and main game mechanics programmer 

Star Battle is a logic puzzle played on a square grid divided into irregular regions. Your goal is to place a fixed number of stars in the grid so that each row, each column, and each region contains exactly that many stars. Stars cannot touch/be adjacent, not even diagonally.
